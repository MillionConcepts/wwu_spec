    "The are some samples in the database that give grain size in micrometers as 'um' and some that give it as 'microns'. Also, some samples have spaces between SI unit abbreviations and numerals, and some don't. Let's say you'd like to regularize this to always use 'um' for micrometers and also not have spaces between numerals and abbreviations. This replacement may be too crude, so we include print statements to see if it's good or not. *(TODO: If it is, move on to regex, maybe or maybe not beyond the scope of this manual. -- michael)*"
