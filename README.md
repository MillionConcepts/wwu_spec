## Description

VISOR is a search and visualization engine for reflectance spectra in
visible and infrared wavelengths. It is currently in open beta. It has a 
publicly-accessible web version, [which you can access at https://www.westernreflectancelab.com/visor/](https://www.westernreflectancelab.com/visor/).

We developed VISOR in support of our research group's analyses of hyper- 
and multi-spectral imaging data of planetary surfaces, and to share 
laboratory data acquired at WWU. We hope it will be a useful resource for 
other planetary researchers and the larger scientific community.

## Usage

The easiest way to use VISOR is simply to access the live site:
[https://www.westernreflectancelab.com/visor/](https://www.westernreflectancelab.com/visor/).

If you would like to install a local copy for your personal use, perhaps to
ingest and manipulate your own data, please see 
[the local installation guide](visor_local_installation_guide.md).
Some reference tricks and recipes for advanced local usage can be found in 
the [programming manual](visor_programming_manual.ipynb).

VISOR does not come with a populated database. If you would like a populated
database to experiment with, please contact `mstclair@millionconcepts.com`
with a description of your use case.
