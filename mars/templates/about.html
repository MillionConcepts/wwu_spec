            <h4>About the WWU VNIRSD</h4>
            <p>The Western Washington University Vis-NIR Spectroscopy
                Database (VNIRSD) is an online tool for searching, graphing,
                and downloading publicly-available laboratory spectra. We
                have developed this tool to aid in our research group's
                analyses of hyper- and multi-spectral imaging data of
                planetary surfaces, and to share laboratory data acquired
                by WWU's Mars Spectroscopy Lab. We hope that this web tool
                will be a useful resource for other planetary researchers
                and the larger scientific community.</p>
            <p>This is a beta version of the tool that has been made
                available to a limited subset of the Mars science community
                for testing. We want to hear from you if you have spectra
                to contribute or if you have ideas about how we can make
                the site more useful.</p>
            <p>Want to contribute? <a href="{{ CSVFormat.document.url }}">Format
                your data</a> and contact Melissa Rice (ricem5@wwu.edu).

            <h5>Attribution</h5>
            <p>The VNIRSD was created by:</p>
            <ul>Michael St. Clair and Chase Million-- software development
                and UX design
            </ul>
            <ul>Melissa Rice -- research and requirements design</ul>
            <p>The VNIRSD is based on an older tool developed by Kyle Mellander
                with significant input from Darian Dixon and students in the
                WWU Mars Lab.

            <p>If you use this database in your research, please cite the
                sources of spectra
                used. We would also appreciate that you acknowledge your use of
                the Western Washington
                University Vis-NIR Spectroscopy Database and link to this page
                [note to closed alpha
                testers: don't link to this particular page, as it is unlikely
                to continue to exist!]
            </p>
            <p>Individual spectra in the database are sourced from the data
                providers listed in the metadata of each spectrum and
                summarized below.
